            <h3 class="substrengthstext">What started my passion for writing?</h3>
            <span class="substrengthstext">I can't pinpoint where it started, but I do know that
                teachers have always complimented my assignments. Narratives were always my 
                favorites, and I always enjoyed writing the details. Describing various sights,
                smells, and sounds were joyous, and I loved to write metaphors and similes to my
                hearts content. Once I was told that I had some talent for it, I gained enough
                confidence to start my own writings. Quick short stories turned into me trying
                to start my own book. The first one was scrapped after my grandma passed. It 
                was one I spent working on at her house every weekend that I spent up there. It
                was too juvine and too close to my heart to finish. It still sits in my google
                drive files, waiting to be finished or rewrote.

            <h3 class="substrengthstext">What am I working on now?</h3>
            <span class="substrengthstext">One night, a close friend and I were talking and; somehow,
                in the early mornings of the day, we came up with a good book idea. We, from then on,
                decided to write it together. It's been very slow progress and I've been working on it
                by myself for a bit, but I really do enjoy the concept and want to finish it eventually.
                The title is currently "Thursday at 4pm" because that was the date and time we wanted to
                get together to work on it. Unfortunately that never happened.
