                        <span class="substrengthstext">The first time I created a website was
                            in 5th grade. I got to do it for a school project using wix.com. It
                            was very basic, and I wasn't actually coding, but I did enjoy the 
                            experience. Later, when given the chance in 8th grade, I signed up for a Web 
                            Development class. I don't exactly remember the name, but I do know 
                            that I learned HTML and CSS to make my own website. I distinctly 
                            remember my website being about golden-doodles, which is a breed of dog.
                            I had a fantastic time with it, and that's what encouraged me to sign 
                            up for an Intro to Comp Sci class!

                        <h3 class="substrengthstext">What are my aspirations for web development?</h3>
                        <span class="substrengthstext">I hope to go into UX design and development. I 
                            find web development to be a lot of fun and I have always had an interest in
                            human behaviour and psychology. I have a logical and analytical brain as well 
                            as being a creative and expressive person. Finding a pairing for these attributes 
                            was always hard. It was either I go into the computer science field and become 
                            a data analysist and software developer, or I can go into the art field and become 
                            a freelance artist or graphic designer. Interactive media and UX design are the 
                            combinations of that!
