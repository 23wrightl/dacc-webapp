                        <span class="substrengthstext">My mom first signed me up for an art camp at The Art Barn. 
                            There I discovered a passion to create art! It started off with me taking more art 
                            classes in middle school in favor of continuing orchestra. I took Ceramics I and II, 
                            Painting, and Drawing. I took all that they offered and even dropped a Culinary class
                            for it! Once I got to highschool I took Art I, Drawing I and II, and Digital Design I. 
                            I also dove into my school's theater program. I participated in my middle schools theater
                            for all three years I attended, then became a stage manager my freshman year at my highschool.
                            I am still currently a stage manager in my theater program! I also took Stagecraft as a class!

                        <h3 class="substrengthstext">What are my favorite mediums of art?</h3>
                        <span class="substrengthstext">My absolute favorite medium is graphite; although, I have dabbled
                            in painting, water color, and colored pencils! I have created many pieces in graphite with 
                            a specialty in portraits! My interest in portraits started when my Art I class had a final
                            assignment of drawing an eye. Every since I have expanded from that and created entire
                            portraits! I also have drawing objects such as a purple lego piece drawn in colored pencil 
                            and a graphite architecture piece of my multiple dream snapshots.
