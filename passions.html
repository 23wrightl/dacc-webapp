            <h3 class="strengthstext">The definition of design:</h3>
            <span class="strengthstext"> Merriam-webster defines design as "to devise for a specific function or 
                end." My definition of design is to plan out a creative idea, that serves a purpose to someone or 
                something. This purpose must be used to help, never hurt. When I design things, I don't think
                about it much. Normally, I just spill all my random thoughts onto a page. I don't have much strategy
                or much design knowledge to back me up. Various research has helped me piece together what I know, 
                and I only really follow what looks pleasing to me. I am excited to learn the psychology behind it
                though and UX design seems like a potential career path for me!

            <h3 class="strengthstext">What are tiny homes?</h3>
            <span class="strengthstext">Tiny homes are a dwelling that occupy 400 square feet or
                less. They come in many different forms, such as living in a shed-like structure, 
                shipping containers, and even in school buses! Many people choose this down-sizing
                lifestyle to cut down on money, possessions, or just to give themselves the chance
                to travel. A nomadic lifestyle is a big possibility when you live in a tiny home on
                wheels! There are hundreds of websites, youtube videos, and tutorials for how to
                enter this lifestyle and build your own tiny home, and hopefully, I will be able to
                join it too!

            <h3 class="strengthstext">The complexities and simplicity of art:</h3>
            <span class="strengthstext">My love for art has always stemmed from my love for design.
                The desire to create has always been there and I find that creativity is my greatest
                strength. Art just so happened to be the side-effect of that. I love to create art and 
                I am proud of what I have created; however, I have always had issues with my perfectionism. 
                It causes me to nitpick every detail, and it makes every project I start, daunting. The
                thought that it won't live up to the idea in my head is tough to deal with. Despite this,
                I have still pushed myself to start and finish many pieces of art and I am very happy with how 
                many of them have turned out!

            <h3 class="strengthstext">What is writing to me?</h3>
            <span class="strengthstext">Writing comes in many different forms. There are many many 
                genres of writing out there, and to be a writer is a great feat. I, myself, can not
                claim that I am a writer, I merely enjoy writing itself. Writing is not my sole intent 
                in life, and I have many more plans outside of writing my own novel. Maybe, if I do 
                end up writing that book, I can call myself one, but today is not that day. That does 
                not mean I draw any less satisfaction from letting the words in my head spill onto the 
                pages of my documents, journals, and notes. Writing is an escape, just like reading!

            <h3 class="strengthstext">The theater in my head:</h3>
            <span class="strengthstext">Once, I sat down with my brother to talk about why he didn't
                enjoy reading. He told me that it was boring, and all he saw was the words on the page. 
                Hearing this news, I was shocked. Whenever I read, I always see it. It's a movie of my 
                own creation. If I pick up a good book, the details fall into place and I watch the book 
                as if it were a movie. It's almost like a spell. I am entraced by the book, and the words 
                on the page seem to dissapear. When I am interrupted by the bustling of the world, the 
                words come back to me and my stage fades away. My books are my outlet, my escape.
