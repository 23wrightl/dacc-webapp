                        <span class="substrengthstext">My first experience with game design was 
                            in 9th grade. I took an Intro to Comp Sci class and we were learning 
                            JavaScript. To test our knowledge, we needed to make two final projects.
                            The first project was an interactive card, and the second project was a
                            video game of choice. My interactive card was one in which I invited 
                            somebody to hang out. Going through the pages, they had to choose the
                            different options for movies, snacks, and drinks! For the game, I made a 
                            quest style game inspired by slime rancher!

                        <h3 class="substrengthstext">What are my favorite types of games?</h3>
                        <span class="substrengthstext">My preference in games lies in story games.
                            Visual novels and simulations both capture my attention. Games with elaborate 
                            plots enrapture my attention just as much as reading. The simulation games 
                            also are relaxing. There is something calming about completing the same task 
                            over and over again. Building something to your design and not worring about 
                            the real world consequences are nice. It is another form of escapism that I 
                            thoroughly enjoy.
