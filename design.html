            <h3 class="substrengthstext">Where did my interest come from?</h3>
            <span class="substrengthstext">I have always embraced my creative side. At first, I thought that I would 
                become an engineer or entrepreneur. I would design and prototype my many ideas. Then, I discovered the
                world of computer science and got to design my own video games and interactive cards. I loved the idea
                of creating something with just an idea in my head. Thus, my reason for loving design!

            <h3 class="substrengthstext">What are my favorite tools for design?</h3>
            <span class="substrengthstext">My favorite tools for design are the Adobe applications. I started learning Adobe 
                InDesign in my Intro to Journalism class. Using this, I wrote a series of different types of journalistic writings 
                and designed and created a magazine! After I took my Intro to Journalism class, I decided to take a Digital Design
                class. In that class I learned to use Adobe Illustrator. Using Illustrator, I created multiple projects, including 
                a poly-portrait, a flat design winter scene, and a travel poster for Crater Lake! After that class, I became very
                interested in interactive media. I decided to take a summer college class at Columbus State Community College called
                Fundamentals of Interactive Media. There I learned to use Adobe Photoshop to create various posters, Adobe Animate to
                create basic animations, and Adobe Dreamweaver to create websites with HTML and CSS. Overall, the Adobe applications
                and systems are my favorite to use!
